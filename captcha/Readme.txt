Provides captcha support (Requires the php_gd library).



Installation and configuration:

1. Copy the captcha plugin folder into you mod folder,
2. Enable the captcha plugin in the admin section of your site.

The captcha plugin also works with the walled-garden option of Elgg core enabled. If you use the alternative walled-garden plugin loginrequired released by me, you need to place the captcha plugin above the loginrequired plugin in the plugin list on your site.
